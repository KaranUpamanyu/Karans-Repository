Editable HTML Table with sorting &amp; Download as .xls options

There's 4 columns in the table- key, anotherfield (could be use for name or whatever), time of entry and delete (button).
we can delete/add rows.
when the download button is clicked, user enters the name for the file, then the table is sorted (alphabetically with respect to the key), and the sorted table is downloaded.
Theres 1 issue as of now- when the file is downloaded, the border of the cells (in the excel file) covers an extra column (mostly due to the delete button).

Thats it. Any help would be appreciated. Theres no licenses, feel free to use the code however youd like to ;)
